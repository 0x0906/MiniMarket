# MiniMarket

**MiniMarket** is a simple billing software demo built with React Native and Expo. It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and simulate payments with both success and failure responses. The app uses React Navigation for smooth navigation, React Context for cart management, and includes reusable components like product cards and numeric increment boxes.
